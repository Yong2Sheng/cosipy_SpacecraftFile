## Version 0.2.x

Version 0.2.0 is the first released version of the "new" cosipy. It was reimplemented from scratch based on the "old" cosipy, now called "[cosipy classic](https://github.com/cositools/mirror-cosipy-classic)". It is the version used for [Data Challenge 2](https://github.com/cositools/cosi-data-challenge-2). Versions 0.2.x have bug fixes for version 0.2.0 but keep backward compatibility and do not add new features.
